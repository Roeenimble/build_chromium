Bootstrap environment for building Chromium on Linux.

This project is useful when you want to quickly setup an CI environment
for building Chromium. The source code of Chromium is downloaded via offical
source tarball so the slow "gclient sync" is avoided. The downside with
this approach is the source tarball can only be used to build for Linux
targets.

Supporting Windows and macOS is possible but we need to generate a source
tarball that works for all platforms, anyone interested should try to bring
life back to this project first:
